A SoundCloud clone built with React, Redux, and Ruby on Rails. A space to share and discover new music.

Users can upload songs, follow other users, favorite songs, comment on songs, and search for other users/songs.

## Technologies used

I used Ruby on Rails for the backend, including user authentication and MVC patterns. I used PostgreSQL to store the data.

For the frontend, I used React for the single-page application UI and Redux for state management.

For the waveform graphics, I found a cool waveform visualizer called [wavesurfer.js](https://github.com/katspaugh/wavesurfer.js/blob/master/README.md), which I wrapped with a React component.
